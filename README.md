# Cyber Security Scoring System (CSSS)

Cyber Security Scoring System (CSSS) is a program to assist with training for the CyberPatriot / CyberCenturion competitions.

While it is currently possible to create [your own practice images](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/competition/training-materials/practice-images), there is only a scoring client for Windows computers. To assist with training competitors with Windows, Ubuntu and Debian Operating Systems, this program has been created to provide a scoring system for them.
